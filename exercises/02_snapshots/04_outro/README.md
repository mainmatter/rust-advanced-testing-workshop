# Outro

Congrats, you just made it to the end of our section on snapshot testing!

Snapshot testing is a surprisingly simple technique, but it can be a real game changer. 
Error messages, `Debug` representations, API responses, macro expansions: the list of things you can
test more easily with snapshots is long!  
If you have any questions around `insta`, this is a good time to pull me over and ask them!
