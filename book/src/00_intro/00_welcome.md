# Welcome

Welcome to **"Advanced Rust testing"**!\
No application is an island: you need to interact with third-party APIs, databases and who knows what else.
Testing those interactions is tricky, to say the least! This course will focus on expanding your Rust testing toolkit,
going beyond the basic techniques you're already familiar with.
At the end of the course you'll have a strategy to test most of the scenarios that are relevant for a complex Rust
application.

The course assumes you have a good understanding of Rust's basic concepts and want to
move beyond the built-in testing toolkit.

## Methodology

This course is based on the "learn by doing" principle.\
You'll build up your knowledge in small, manageable steps. It has been designed to be interactive and hands-on.

[Mainmatter](https://mainmatter.com/rust-consulting/) developed this course
to be delivered in a classroom setting, over a whole day: each attendee advances
through the lessons at their own pace, with an experienced instructor providing
guidance, answering questions and diving deeper into the topics as needed.\
If you're interested in attending one of our training sessions, or if you'd like to
bring this course to your company, please [get in touch](https://mainmatter.com/contact/).

You can also take the course on your own, but we recommend you find a friend or
a mentor to help you along the way should you get stuck. You can
also find solutions to all exercises in the
[`solutions` branch of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-advanced-testing-workshop/tree/solutions).

## Prerequisites

To follow this course, you must install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).\
If Rust is already installed on your machine, make sure to update it to the latest version:

```bash
# If you installed Rust using `rustup`, the recommended way,
# you can update to the latest stable toolchain with:
rustup update stable
```

You'll also need the `nightly` toolchain, so make sure to install it:

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

Don't start the course until you have these tools installed and working.

## Structure

On the left side of the screen, you can see that the course is divided into sections.\
To verify your understanding, each section is paired with an exercise that you need to solve.

You can find the exercises in the
[companion GitHub repository](https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-advanced-testing-workshop).\
Before starting the course, make sure to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
# If you have an SSH key set up with GitHub
git clone git@github.com:mainmatter/rust-advanced-testing-workshop.git
# Otherwise, use the HTTPS URL:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/mainmatter/rust-advanced-testing-workshop.git
```

We recommend you work on a branch, so you can easily track your progress and pull
updates from the main repository if needed:

```bash
cd rust-advanced-testing-workshop
git checkout -b my-solutions
```

All exercises are located in the `exercises` folder.
Each exercise is structured as a Rust package.
The package contains the exercise itself, instructions on what to do (in `src/lib.rs`), and a mechanism to
automatically verify your solution.

### `wr`, the workshop runner

To verify your solutions, we've also provided a tool to guide you through the course: the `wr` CLI, short for "workshop runner".
Install `wr` by following the instructions on [its website](https://mainmatter.github.io/rust-workshop-runner/).

Once you have `wr` installed, open a new terminal and navigate to the top-level folder of the repository.
Run the `wr` command to start the course:

```bash
wr
```

`wr` will verify the solution to the current exercise.\
Don't move on to the next section until you've solved the exercise for the current one.

> We recommend committing your solutions to Git as you progress through the course,
> so you can easily track your progress and "restart" from a known point if needed.

Enjoy the course!
